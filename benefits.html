      <h2>Employment grades</h2>

      <section>
        <p>Grades determine the rate of basic pay associated with a specific level of work or range of difficulty,
          responsibility, and qualification requirements.</p>

        <h3>United Nations Common System</h3>

        <p>Most International Organizations follow the United Nations Common System professional grade structure.
          Please note that the years of experience referred to in the chart is years of <em>relevant</em> experience
          after the completion of an undergraduate degree, unless stated otherwise in the individual vacancy
          announcement. As these positions are very competitive it is recommended that you apply to positions for
          which you exceed the minimum years of experience.</p>

        <h3>Coordinated organizations (NATO, OECD, and others)</h3>
        <p>The A category is made up of seven levels, the entrance level being A1 and the most senior being A7. Most
          staff are at A3 and A4 levels. Levels A5 and above are considered management levels. Level A1 is considered
          transitory and generally only applied to trainees. Each Coordinated Organization has a separate but similar
          manner of determining the level of A grade posts. Some organizations apply a point factor system while
          others practice a &quot;whole level&quot; description method. Some organizations may offer positions with a
          range of grades, such as A2/A3.</p>

        <h3>Other international organizations</em></h3>
        <p>Please visit the employment pages of individual international organizations to learn more about unique
          professional grading systems if the organization of your choice is using a different system than those
          listed above. Please view our <a href="/faq.html#io-contact-info">international organization contact

        <h2>Salaries</h2>

        <p>Salaries established by international organizations are typically competitive. Since countries
          generally do
          not tax their nationals&rsquo; income from international organizations, most international organizations
          (including UN agencies) set salaries on a &quot;net-of-tax&quot; basis. In addition, they provide
          other
          allowances that vary according to individual circumstances and the cost-of-living at the work
          location.
          The
          most important of these allowances is the &quot;post adjustment,&quot; which serves to equalize purchasing
          power
          for international civil servants wherever they serve.</p>

        <p>While salaries are usually quoted in dollars, they are paid in whole or part in the currency of the country
          where the individual serves. The take-home pay, therefore, can vary with changes in the dollar exchange
          rate.
        </p>

        <p>To determine whether the salary and benefits package offered by an international organization is
          desirable,
          applicants should compare the international organization's &quot;net&quot; salary plus post
          adjustment
          and any other offered allowances with their current &quot;after-withholding&quot; salary, allowances and
          benefits.
        </p>

        <h3>United Nations Common System</h3>

        <p>Pay in the professional and senior positions is made up of two main elements: 1) base salary and 2)
          post
          adjustment. UN salaries are based on those of the U.S. Civil Service plus an amount that will
          vary
          from 10-20%.</p>

        <p>All U.S. citizens and permanent residents remain subject to federal income tax and also may be subject to
          U.S. state and local taxes. However, special tax provisions apply to Americans working overseas, for
          example,
          with international organizations. For authoritative information on federal taxes for these cases, see <a
            href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p54.pdf">IRS
            Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad</a>. For information on state or
          local taxes,
          please consult the tax authority's guidance.</p>

        <p>In general, employees who meet certain residency requirements, may exclude up to $112,000 (2022) of their
          international organization income from federal taxes. Also, some international organizations offer
          tax incentives to employees. Candidates are encouraged to consider tax ramifications of employment
          prior
          to accepting any offer from an international organization.</p>

        <p>For U.S. government employees, pursuant to Public Law 103-296, FICA tax is required for all transferred
          employees
          even if they do not continue their CSRS Offset or FERS coverage during the transfer. While employed by an
          international
          organization, an employee's FICA tax, retirement and insurance contributions are based on the amount
          of pay the employee would have received had he or she remained at the transferring agency. Whether or not
          the employee elects retirement coverage, the employee is no longer exempt from FICA tax during service with
          the international organization.</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>

        <p>Please visit the <a href="http://icsc.un.org">International Civil Service
            Commission</a> and <a href="http://www.sirp-isrp.org/index.php?lang=en">Coordinated
            Organisations (CO)</a> websites to learn more about the benefits offered by the majority of
          international
          organizations. If the international organization of interest is not a part of either group please
          visit our <a href="/faq.html#io-contact-info">international organization
            contact information</a> page for links to the employment pages of specific international
          organizations.</p>
