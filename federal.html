      <h1>Federal agencies and employees</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          Federal Agencies may detail or transfer employees to any organization that the Department of State has
          designated an
          international organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          A detail or transfer may not exceed 5 years but may be extended 3 additional years upon the approval of the
          head of the agency and the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of International Organization Affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employees who transferred are entitled to be reemployed (as provided in 5 CFR 352 Subpart C) in their
          former position or one of like status within 30 days of application for reemployment subject to
          prior approval by the Federal Agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon reemployment, employees are entitled to the same rate of pay they would have been entitled to had
          they remained continuously in the Federal service and sick
          leave restored to its status at the time they left Federal service.

        <h3>Junior Professional Officer (JPO) Programs</h3>


        <p>U.S. federal government agencies may sponsor U.S. citizens to work for international organizations through
          Junior Professional Officer programs (sometimes referred to as Associate Expert or Associate Professional
          Officer programs.) These programs are administered by individual international organizations and a great way
          for Member States to support the work of an organization as well as the career development of its nationals.
        </p>

        <p>Federal agencies can sponsor JPOs with any international organization with whom the U.S. government has a
          signed Memorandum of Understanding. Please visit our <a
            href="students-jpo.html#junior-professional-officer-program">JPO</a> page for more
          information about
          current U.S. JPO partnerships.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in partnering with an organization that is not on our list, please <a

      <section>

        <h2>Federal Employees</h2>
        <p>Eligible U.S. government employees may be detailed or transferred to certain international organizations
          (IOs) in which the United States participates. Authority and procedures for such details and transfers
          are found in: 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3343, 358l-3584 and 5 C.F.R. and &sect;&sect; 352.301 through
          352.314.</p>

        <h3>How do I negotiate and approve a detail or transfer?</h3>

        <p>Upon receipt of a written request from an international organization for the services of an employee, an
          agency may approve and authorize the detail or transfer of the employee to the organization for any
          period, not to exceed five (5) years.</p>

        <p>The agency retains the option of refusing the request for a transfer to an international
          organization. Refusal to grant such a request is not appealable.</p>

        <p>At the time of approval of transfer, the employee must agree, and acknowledge in writing to the agency,
          those federal benefits (and required payments) which he/she wishes to retain while on transfer, including
          retirement, health benefits, life insurance, and the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).</p>

        <p>Note: At the formal request of an international organization or a federal official, and subject to
          prior approval by the agency, no leave shall be charged to an employee who is absent for a maximum of three
          days to interview for a proposed detail or transfer. Also, an agency may approve official travel
          within the United States in connection with such an interview.</p>

        <h3>What about my federal benefits?</h3>

        <p>Federal employees serving on appointments of one year or more can detail or transfer to an international
          organization and retain certain rights and benefits offered by the federal government.</p>

        <p>At the time of approval of a transfer to an international organization, a federal agency must offer the
          employee the opportunity to continue participating in his or her current retirement, health benefits, and
          group life insurance programs while seconded to an international organization, and indicate in writing that
          it will continue to make the agency's share of contributions to these programs. To retain such
          coverage, however, the employee must make his or her contributions during the entire period of the
          secondment. If the employee fails to make such contributions, benefits will be lost during the period
          of secondment.</p>

        <p>An employee is not eligible to participate in TSP while employed by the international organization, but
          upon reemployment, if the employee opted to retain federal retirement coverage, he or she may make
          contributions to the TSP and receive make-up agency contributions and lost earnings on the agency
          contributions that he or she missed as a result of service to the international organization.</p>

        <p>If the employee retained coverage while on transfer, upon reemployment, the period of separation covered by
          the transfer is eligible to be deemed employment by the United States. Note that double retirement
          coverage is not permitted. The employee may not earn and retain credit toward a U.S. government
          retirement benefit for a period of service at an international organization if that same period of service
          is used to qualify for the international organization's retirement plan.</p>

        <p>Special conditions exist for employees covered by the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) or the
          Foreign Service Pension System (FSPS). Legislation passed in August 1994 permits continuation of
          contributions to the FERS and FSPS systems and payment of Social Security (FICA) taxes, enabling FERS and
          FSPS employees to earn retirement credit while on transfer. Retirement credit may be earned upon
          payment of the required employee's share of contributions to the agency from which the employee
          transferred.</p>

        <p>While on detail, your Agency will continue to pay your salary, allowances, and benefits directly. Your
          agency, in accordance with their rules and regulations and any contractual arrangements, will provide
          all social security coverage, including pension, insurance against illness, accident, disability and death,
          whether service incurred or not.</p>

        <p>Agencies can also be responsible for the cost of travel and relocation of the employee (his/her immediate
          family) and transportation of his/her personal effects between his/her place of residence and his/her duty
          station on appointment and repatriation, in accordance with its rules and regulations.</p>

        <p>The annual, sick, and home leave entitlements of the employee will continue to be administered by the
          Department, and determined in accordance with the terms of the contract between the employee and the agency.
        </p>

        <h3>What are my reemployment rights?</h3>

        <p>If an agency approves a transfer to an international organization, it must grant reemployment rights to the
          employee. The transfer period is deemed creditable service for all appropriate employment purposes,
          including tenure, service computation date, federal retirement, and time in grade.</p>

        <p>A transferred employee must apply for reemployment to his or her former agency, in writing, within 90 days
          after separating without cause from the international organization. However, it is to the
          employee's advantage to notify the former agency at least six months prior to the end of employment at
          the international organization of any intention to return to the federal agency.</p>

        <p>An agency must reemploy the employee within 30 days of applying for reemployment.</p>

        <p>Upon reemployment, an employee is entitled to be restored to his or her former position, or one of like
          seniority, status, and pay that he or she would have been entitled if he or she had remained in U.S.
          government employment.</p>

        <h3>Employment Conditions of Details or Transfers</h3>

        <p>Employees on secondment shall be considered a staff member of the IO during the period of the
          detail/transfer and shall be under the technical and administrative supervision of the IO.</p>

        <p>The employee's immediate IO supervisor may provide statements concerning the quality of the
          employee's performance to the agency from which he/she was detailed/transferred.</p>

        <p>Hours of duty are to be mutually agreed between the employee and the IO.</p>

        <p>The employee shall be entitled to annual and sick leave in accordance with their originating agency's
          regulations governing Foreign or Civil Service employees. The details of this process are determined by
          an agreement between the agency and the employee. Often, these agreements include provisions such as:</p>

        <ol class="usa-list">
          <li>Each application for sick and annual leave must be approved by the employee's IO supervisor</li>
          <li>Requests for sick and annual leave will be recorded on OPM Standard Form SF-71, Application for
            Leave, and forwarded to the employee's home agency.</li>
          <li>The employee will be excused from duty on all U.S. Federal holidays, if not otherwise scheduled for
            duty, without charge to annual leave. They may be excused from duty on a local holiday without
            charge of duty station.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Applicability of Regulations and Policies of IOs</h3>

        <p>The rules and policies governing the internal operation and management of the IO will apply to the
          employee.</p>

        <p>The rules and policies of both the IO and U.S. Government governing standards of conduct shall apply to the
          employee.</p>

        <p>Because the detailee is participating in a U.S. Government retirement plan, the IO will agree to exclude
          the employee from coverage under the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and other accident, illness,
          and health insurance coverages.</p>

        <p>The obligations of the IO are strictly limited to the express terms and conditions of the agreement that is
          drafted to cover such employment. The employee is not entitled to any other payment, allowance, grant
          or indemnity, including compensation for any service incurred event.</p>

        <p>If included in the agreement, the IO may cover all travel costs and applicable per diem to the employee for
          all
          duty travel directed by the IO in accordance with the IO rules and regulations.</p>

        <p>If included in the agreement, the IO may be required to reimburse the U.S. Government agency for 50% of
          special allowances for
          education, cost of living, and housing. In addition, the IO may reimburse the Agency for 50% of costs
          for travel of the officer and family members and transportation of household goods and personal effects to
          and from the place of assignment.</p>

        <h2>Approved International Organizations</h2>
        <p>A federal agency may detail or transfer an employee to any organization that the Department of State has
          designated as an international organization. The list below does not determine
          whether an entity is an international organization for the purpose of other statutes or regulations, it is
          solely for the purpose of detailing or transferring federal employees.</p>

        <p>While the U.S. government participates in other international organizations not listed here, the degree of
          participation may not be enough to warrant designating the organization an IO for the purpose of details and
          transfers. The Department of State will consider the status of such organizations under the detail and
          transfer statutory provisions on a case-by-case basis when requested to do so by Federal agencies.</p>

        <p>Federal agencies interested in learning more about how to add an organization to the list should <a
