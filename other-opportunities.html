          nomination to serve on oversight bodies for UN System organizations. All positions are pro-bono, though
          travel expenses may be covered/reimbursed consistent with U.S. Department of State internal policies and
          legal authorities. Time requirements vary by position, but are approximately 2-4 weeks of service annually.

          compliance.</p>

        <p>Candidates should possess at least 15 years of relevant experience. Relevant experience may include
          management experience in organizations of a similar size and scope, including financial and human resources
          management; knowledge of oversight and accountability structures relevant to the UN System; previous board
          service; and/or technical or specialist activities relating to the organization.</p>

          advantage.</p>

        <p>Candidates may submit their C.V. for multiple openings at one time or to the General Interest link to be
