          <h2>Oversight roles</h2>

          <p>The State Department is seeking candidates with administrative, financial, and/or management experience for
            nomination to serve on oversight bodies for UN System organizations. All positions are pro-bono, though
            travel expenses may be covered/reimbursed consistent with U.S. Department of State internal policies and
            legal authorities. Time requirements vary by position, but are approximately 2-4 weeks of service annually.
          </p>

          <p>The oversight bodies provide independent advice and guidance to international organizations on governance
            topics including audit, evaluation, accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, risk management, and
            compliance.</p>

          <p>Candidates should possess at least 15 years of relevant experience. Relevant experience may include
            management experience in organizations of a similar size and scope, including financial and human resources
            management; knowledge of oversight and accountability structures relevant to the UN System; previous board
            service; and/or technical or specialist activities relating to the organization.</p>

          <p>Knowledge of English is essential; knowledge of Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, or Spanish would be an
            advantage.</p>

          <p>Candidates may submit their C.V. for multiple openings at one time or to the General Interest link to be
            considered for additional opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>
            For consideration, kindly state "General Interest â€“ IO Oversight" when you <a target="_blank"
              href="https://iipstate.my.site.com/iocareersintakeform">submit your expression of interest here.</a>
