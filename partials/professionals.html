        If you're pursuing a position in an international organization,
        the U.S. Government may advocate on your behalf.  U.S. multilateral engagement spans a range of important global issues, including peace and security, nuclear nonproliferation, human rights, economic development, climate change, global health, and food security. Given these policy priorities, and as the largest financial contributor to the UN and many other international organizations, the U.S. government has a vested interest in the composition of staff at these organizations.
