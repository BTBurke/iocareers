            For American citizens looking for careers with true international impact, working at the United Nations is an opportunity of a lifetime.  Whether it’s addressing conflict, climate change, global health, human rights, or economic development, there is an important role to play.  And that role has impacts right here at home – impacts on Americans and the U.S. economy.  
            <br><br>
            The UN’s work helps protect U.S. intellectual property rights and innovation in global markets, supports U.S. agricultural and other commodities used in humanitarian efforts, presents U.S. commercial opportunities through procurement of goods and services, and sets norms for internet and telecommunications regulations, among other important fields. 
            <br><br>
            We’d like to invite you to consider opportunities at the UN.  And we’d like to help you pave the way to a meaningful career at the United Nations and in other international organizations.
