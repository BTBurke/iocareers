                Your application is evaluated in terms of experience, education and skills. Only if it is determined
                that
                you meet most or all of the requirements will you be contacted to undergo an assessment (i.e. a
                knowledge-based test or another type of simulation exercise.)
              </p>
              </p>
              If it is determined that you are not eligible or only meet some or none of the requirements for a
              particular position, you will be informed at the appropriate time that your application was unsuccessful.
              In this case, you should not be discouraged but apply for other jobs for which you feel qualified.

              <p>
                The assessment exercise could be either a written exam or any other type of simulation exercise or case
                study. If language is a core requirement of the job you may be asked to complete the assessment in the
                language you are claiming fluency in addition to your native tongue. These assessment exercises are
                conducted in strict confidence and you will be informed in advance of the time, type and length of the
                assessment. If, based on the result of the assessment, you are short-listed for a competency-based
                interview, you are informed accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are not short-listed for the competency-based interview, you will be informed at the appropriate
                time. Please note, however, that the type and frequency of correspondence with individual candidates may
                vary throughout the application process.

              <p>
                The competency-based interview can take place either via telephone, video conference or in person. You
                will be notified in advance of the time, duration and means and/or place of the interview as well as of
                the names of the interview panel members. During the interview, the IO learns more about your
                combination
                of skills, attributes and behavior that are directly related to your successful performance on the job.

              <p>
                Based on all the findings of the various evaluation and assessment stages, a pool of qualified
                candidates
                is recommended for selection. Such a recommendation is reviewed by an independent body, composed of
                staff
                and management representatives, which makes sure that the applicable procedures were followed correctly
                and that all applicants were considered in a fair, transparent and objective manner. After the review
                body
                has endorsed the recommended candidates, the head of the department makes a selection.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are the selected candidate, you are informed that you have been selected. If you were in the
                group
                of candidates recommended for selection, but you were not selected for a particular job opening, you
                will
                be informed that you were included in the relevant roster for possible future selection. This means that
                within a period of two years for men and three years for women, you may be contacted to confirm your
                interest in an upcoming similar job opening in the same job family and at the same level without having
                to
                undergo the entire application process again. Even if you have been included in the roster, you should
                actively continue to apply for job openings for which you feel qualified.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are not included in the pool of candidates recommended for selection, you will be informed at the
                appropriate time.

          <h2>Understanding roster management</h2>
          <p>
            A roster is a pool of candidates who have already been vetted as viable candidates through the application
            process and who are ready for immediate selection. If you have been informed of your inclusion in the
            roster, either based on the recommendation for a specific or for a generic job opening, you can potentially
            be selected for an upcoming job opening without having to repeat the entire application process. Once you
            are included in a roster, you will be regularly contacted by e-mail to either confirm your continued
            interest in upcoming job openings, or you may choose to temporarily put on hold or permanently withdraw your
            roster candidature.

          <h2>Shortlist support</h2>
          <p>
            If you are “shortlisted” for a vacancy you applied for, please <a href="mailto:IO-Careers@state.gov">contact
              us</a> so we can assess the status of
            your application. The UN and many other international organizations have various definitions of what being
            shortlisted really means but it typically means that you have been invited for an interview and are
            considered to be a finalist for the position.

          <h2>Appointments based on gender and geographic balance</h2>
          <p>
            To enable as many member states as possible to have their nationals represented on the professional staffs,
            the UN and some other international organizations consider geographic balance when filling vacancies.
            Some UN agencies have developed formulas for determining the “desirable range” for equitable representation
            of member countries on their staffs. These formulas are generally based on member states’ financial
            contributions, their population, and general membership.
            Some UN agencies are also seeking to hire more qualified women applicants in hopes of increasing the
            representation of women in professional and senior posts.
