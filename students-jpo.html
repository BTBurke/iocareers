      <h1>Students and Young Professionals</h1>

      <section>
        <p>
          Most professional posts in the UN and other international organizations require several years of
          experience and advanced degrees; however, there are a few programs in place to help highly qualified
          students
          and young professionals get their foot in the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your background does not fit the ideal description for these programs, consider gaining field experience
          by
          working for a relevant non-governmental organization, non-profit, or applying to volunteer with the Peace
          Corps. You will gain technical and language skills, along with international experience, that will make your
          application for a position with an international organization more competitive.

        <h2>Internships</h2>
          <p>
            There are many different internship programs across the UN System and in other international
            organizations.
            Review the links below to get detailed information about these programs and their respective application
            processes, as the requirements vary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind the following tips when applying for internships:
          <ul class="usa-list">
            <li>The application process is very competitive,
              You should review the requirements carefully and devote enough time to completing your application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not all international organizations advertise internship opportunities. If there is an organization you're
              interested in
              but you can't find a publicly available list of internships, reach out to the organization directly to
              ask.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regional offices tend to be less competitive than headquarters positions. You should apply for a variety
              of positions both at
              the headquarters and in the field to improve your chances.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some organization, such as the UN Secretariat, impose a "cooling off period" between the end of the
              internship and an offer of full full-time
              employment. If you're looking to transition from an internship into a permanent position, you should
              research the policies of the organization you're applying to.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>UN Secretariat Internship Program</h3>
            <p>
              Internships in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/secretariat">UN Secretariat</a> are usually
              full-time, between three to six months in duration, and may take place during
              certain
              periods of the year. Be vigilant about application procedures and deadlines as they vary depending on
              the
              vacant position. Please visit the <a href="https://careers.un.org/lbw/home.aspx?viewtype=IP">UN
                Secretariat's
